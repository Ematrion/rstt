    "## Project description\n",
    "#### League of Legends Global Power Ranking \n",
    "In September 2024, Riot Games introduced their **Global Power Ranking**, a [ranking](https://lolesports.com/en-US/news/dev-diary-unveiling-the-global-power-rankings) for professional League of Legends teams. At is core,  a modified Elo system modeling not only the teams, but also regions as part of an international eco-system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionaly to the Global Power Ranking, we also build a simple **Calendar**. The Calendar responsability is to to generate a somewhat realistic/meaningfull synthetic dataset to evaluate ranking design.\n",
    "By following the structure of *League of Legend* international competition, it produces data suited for the ranking considerations. You can find detail about it on [Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net/leagueoflegends/Main_Page)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Design a ranking in the spirit of the package\n",
    "- Use and combine format of competition to create a complex dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From there on, we will simply refer to *GPR* for the ranking, and *LoL* for League of Legends\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tutorial Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to make the notebook work. To achieve this you need to implement several components of the rstt framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *project* forlder you'll find python module where you work on your implement."

    "\n",
    "[Competition](https://rstt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rstt.scheduler.tournament.html#rstt.scheduler.tournament.competition.Competition) is an abstract class from which inherit tournament format such as [Round-Robin](https://rstt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rstt.scheduler.tournament.html#rstt.scheduler.tournament.groups.RoundRobin) or [Single Elimination Bracket](https://rstt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rstt.scheduler.tournament.html#rstt.scheduler.tournament.knockout.SingleEliminationBracket). The LoL calendar consist of events for which the rstt already provides a corresponding implementation. For tutorial purpose, we propose to work on a **StagedEvent** class (where different format are played in a succession of stages) to illustrate the devellopement process.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on a Competition, you want to be able to instanciate it with seedings, a solver and a name (used as identifier). You also want to 'register' participants and 'run' it. The following code snippet illustrate how the magic happends. It is **not** the exact implementation, but gives the necessary information to understand the logic of the class.\n",

In our project, the resulting games are used to update the ranking, and the final placement is used to qualify teams to other events. These are two important features of the StagedEvent class.

    "## 2. Implementation of a Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ranking]() in rstt consists of:\n",
    "- a [standing](): sorts automatically competitors accordingly to their ratings.\n",
    "- a [datamodel](): container for rating.\n",
    "- a [backend](): tool to infer ratings, 'the maths'. \n",
    "- an [handler](): a workflow handling the update from observations to new ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to instanciate a ranking simply by specifying the suited components. However, it is also possible to inherit from the class and override the [forward](https://rstt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rstt.ranking.html#rstt.ranking.ranking.Ranking.forward) method which allows us to tune the ranking state at update time. The following code snippet illustrate the default implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def update(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "    self.forward(*args, **kwargs) ->\n",
    "        self.handler.handle_observation(infer=self.backend, datamodel=self.datamodel, *args, **kwargs)\n",
    "    # automatic ordering of the standing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important remarks. First the ranking **does not care** about ratings explicitly. It is an implict agreement between the components. As long as the backend can manipulate the ratings provided by the handler (and returned by datamodel.get) it should work. It is recommanded to not 'hard code' ratings so that the ranking keeps maximal flexibility and that component remains as independant from each others as possible. Secondly, 'observations' - the things that justify a ranking update, passed as *args **kwargs - are dealt by the handler. The handler needs to extract the relevant information from it. You are free to decide what the ranking takes as input and how to process them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Global Power Ranking Logic and Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPR has its own specificity aswell. It rate leagues, this means we need dedicated Player to represent them because ranking and datamodel are designed for SPlayer. Ratings are evaluated game by game over a time window using an elo rational where games do not all have the same importance. These *extra* notions are develloped in the utils module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- (A) 'league' players\n",
    "- (B) a database\n",
    "- (C) adjust game importance\n",
    "- (D) reset ratings (so that only the game in the time period count)\n",
    "- (E) identify the scene and stage (regional/international) of an event\n",
    "\n",
    "In the turorial, we use a consistent naming convention (define in the scene module) for competition. This way we can extract the needed information to set the importance of the corresponding game. This mean the GPR will take an 'event: Event' parameter  for update (refered as observation). \n",
