    "#### Error Details\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Motivation**\n",
    "RSTT is a powerfull package that enables production of multi millions games dataset in reasonable time. It is also meant for scientifical reseach, synthetic **data must be well defined** and strickly be the consequences of a specified model. Many errors raised by the package are annoying and seem unnecessary. They are here to ensure data integrity. They tell researcher and reviewer that something is not quiet right. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **What happened ?**\n",
    "At the very end of the Competition.run execution, paricipants *receive* an [Achievement](https://rstt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rstt.html#rstt.stypes.Achievement), resulting in a ValueError raised by the player. You could execute multiple times the same event using BasicPlayer, since they do not track achievement, no error would occure.\n",
    "The error is raised after all games have been played and a standing was decided and only by player tracking achievements. The problem is not the game, the players , the solver nor the competition handling. It just make no sense to host twice a **World Cup 2025**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **What to do ?**\n",
    "Either use BasicPlayer or a consistant naming convention for event. A formated string with an index in an enumerated for-loop works just fine.\n",
    "Sometimes you realy, realy do need twice the exact same event with the same participants. In that case there is a player.reset() method, as an explicit syntax, that eraise object history."

    "3) Simulation Protocol. How do component interact with each. When do you play game and update a ranking. When do you update the player level or change solver ? The entire synthethic dataset production is under your control, inculding the inter-play between a test set and the training/validation set.\n",
    "Let's keep it simple here. We play **one single swiss-sound tournament edition with initial random seed**. Then update our test ranking.\n",
    "Typically a ranking under test has no prior information, i.e. all players have the same ratings and the ordering is assumed random.\n",

    "What is fantastic with simulation is that you know the actual level of player and can compare infered ratings with the **groudtruth**.\n",

    "\n",
    "RSTT has its own **unique definition** of what a ranking is. You get a glimps of it in Tutorial 2. It is a powerfull one that allows you to integrate externally defined rating system within the RSTT framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will build a simple ranking class that uses the [openskill](https://github.com/vivekjoshy/openskill.py) package to compute ratings within a RSTT simulation. The same approach can be extanded to [trueskill](https://trueskill.org) and probably any system you want to.\n",

    "#### Tutorial 3: Research\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we reproduce a researched on the Elo ranking system. You will code some of the experimentation youself.\n",

    "- Reproduce scientifical research\n",
    "- How to read model specification and translate it into RSTT vocabulary and features\n",
    "- Setup Experimental Protocol\n",
    "- Make cool plot to vizualise simulation results\n",

    "#### Tutorial 4: Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "RSTT allows you to design and implement custom component to combine. The design requirements are kept minimal thanks to high abstraction defining interaction and taking care of automation. We model here an entire professional video gam ecosystem (League of Legend), including ranking specfifcation and leagues structures with international events. We build a model to reflect both game title specificity and ranking consideration. We implement a naive baseline and perform a simple comparative study.\n",
